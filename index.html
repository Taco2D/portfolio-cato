                Within media production, i have quite a varied skillset, with a lot of experience around editing. That includes images, videoes and sound. Most of these I work on with adobe, respectively photoshop, premiere pro and audition.
                Other than editing, I have experience with other areas and programs, such as figma and blender.

                I have used quite a bit of scratch to code, and you can see some of my projects further down the page. <br>
                I also some have experience in gamemaker studio, and I am still learning Godot.<br>
                I have used some HTML and CSS, which you can see in this very page.

                Not all of my skills and characteristics fall under media and programming, such as my creativity. I find it really fun to come up with ideas and concepts, and to bring them to life.<br>
                Another strength I have is that I am quite adaptable to a lot, and learn quick once i really get into something.
